				Bush’s predictions for the future are certainly very intriguing. While I don’t quite understand everything he is trying to say throughout the article exactly, as it is written from a 1940s perspective based on the technology available at the time, generally I can tell he is interested in expanding the human capacity for knowledge through technological advancements. Considering he predicted digital cameras, personal computers and the internet, specifically the functionality of search engines, Bush’s vision was (and remains to be) incredibly spot-on. From my 21st century viewpoint, Bush’s words put modern technology into a humbling perspective. He says “Often it would be advantageous to be able to snap the camera and to look at the picture immediately.” Is this not an aspect of photography we not only take for granted, but expect? Do we not begin to tap our feet impatiently during the one-second wait for our smart phones to load the photo we just took?</p>
				
				<p> These predictions capture the general idea of modern technology but not necessarily the precise execution of it. I’m curious how many others from the time period predicted different outcomes of the future, only to be incorrect. For this reason, is Bush lucky due to the accuracy of his prediction, or was did he actually have amazing foresight?</p>
